# Getting User Input

## Setup

First create a new Python script named `morse_code.py`.

At the top of the file, create a function named `output_morse_code` that requires a single argument named `message`. This function will take the message as an argument and output the message on the LED. For testing purposes, make the `output_morse_code` function simply print out the message for now.

## Input Loop

At the end of the file, create a loop that runs forever. Inside the loop,

* Ask the user to input a message
* Call the `output_morse_code` function with the message the user entered

## Testing

Before going further, make sure that your input code is working. Run your program and input a message. Make sure the message is printed out. Also make sure you get asked to input a message again, and that it is also printed. Stop your program when you are finished testing.

If the program doesn't do what you expect it to, there may be a problem in your code. Identify and fix any problems, then run your program again to check if the problem has been fixed.
